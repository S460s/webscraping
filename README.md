The idea of the project is to 'subscribe' to different search queries.
It then gets the last 20 videos by time and saves them to a json file for checking later as well as a txt file for archive purposes.
(both directories are automatically created on start)

to use, modify the PPL array with the queries you want and change the INTERVAL_IN_MIN var.

things to add -> save the date of creation instead of "15 hours ago".
